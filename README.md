# Email-Spam-Ham-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Email Spam Ham Detection | Naive Bayes | Machine Learning | Python | sklearn | TextBlob | NumPy | Pandas

Developed a python script which predicts whether an email is spam or ham. Trained the program
with large dataset (what a spam email & what ham emails look like). Used the sklearn, nltk library,
n-gram approach, removal of stop words, bag of words, lemmatization, term frequency identification
along with Naive Bayes theorem.
